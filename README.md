# filt_sort_list
Here's what I did:
1) Created a function and specified a list of dictionaries in the argument.
2) Filtered by age, specifying the lambda as a key, a list of dictionaries and wrote a mini-function
3) then sorted through the lambda, already specifying the filtered
4) Printed
5) Called the function
